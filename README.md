# Build_a_Game_Playing_Agent

n this project, you will experiment with adversarial search techniques by building an agent to play knights Isolation. Unlike the examples in lecture where the players control tokens that move like chess queens, this version of Isolation gives each agent control over a single token that moves in L-shaped movements--like a knight in chess.
